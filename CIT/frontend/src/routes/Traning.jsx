          Chartered Institute of Technology Training, Placement and Development Cell play a critical role in networking graduating students 
          with the industry. It prepares the students for the process of recruitment and simultaneously creates awareness among companies 
          about the recruitment opportunities at CIT. Potential recruiters are given structural support for scheduling interviews, 
          hosting seminars, group discussions and written tests. At CIT, Aburoad we believe employability is more than a skill; it is 
          an attitude, it is a practice. So, we instill this attitude through continuous training in learning skills, behavioral skills, 
          and life skills in addition to aptitude and communication skills. This training starts in the first year of engineering itself. 
          Specific Campus Recruitment Training programs are conducted in the third year, with an emphasis on problem solving, critical thinking,
           communication skills and team work.

          Placement training plays a major role in shaping up the career goals of students. It is the dream of every engineering student 
          to get placed in a top organization visiting their campus for recruitment. Keeping this key aspect into consideration, it is 
          realized that training is important for engineering students to enhance their employability skills and achieve good placement 
          in various Industries. At present, the competition for employment is increasing every day and placement has become a challenging
           task. Training of students and equipping them with life skills has become an important responsibility of the institution. Along
            with technical expertise, the development of a holistic personality is also necessary. To meet out these requirements, a fully
            -fledged training cell is operating in our college to enhance the capabilities of engineering graduates on par with the industry
             standards.
