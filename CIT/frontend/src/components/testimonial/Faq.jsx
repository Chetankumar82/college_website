              CIT was established with a student oriented approach in their mind and it is their prime motto 
              to satisfy the students getting enrolled with them.</h2>
                <p className='leading-7'>
                The students at CIT have to be morally satisfied, physically fit, mentally balanced and internally growing. 
                To make sure of it the management team of CIT leave no stone unturned and makes all possible efforts 
                to do the same. Students are morally supported here in CIT and this is why they are happy to be a part 
                of the College.</p>
                <p className='leading-7'>
                The faculty takes care of the studentsâ€™ academic stabilities and helps them to grow better day by day. 
                Special attention is paid to the students who are average or below average in studies. It assures them 
                of getting good score in their examination and hence results in a better future. Internal placements 
                take place in the institutes and those who are extremely talented. But the management makes sure that those who don't 
                get the opportunity are given proper guidance so that they can do well in their career as well outside CIT.
